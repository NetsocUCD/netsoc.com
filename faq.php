				<p class="question">What is Netsoc?</p>
				<div class="answer">
Netsoc is University College Dublin's Internet and Networking Society. The society was founded in 1995 with the primary mandate of providing Internet access to the students of UCD. Since that mandate was met in the early 2000's by the University, Netsoc has evolved by providing a varying range of services. Netsoc provides its members with accounts on its servers, hosting space on UCD's network for developing websites and personal projects as well as system administration training. We also host various tech talks and tutorials on all things technology. Previously this has included web site design, PC building and programming talks, amongst others. </div>
